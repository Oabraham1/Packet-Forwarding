Running times of the different topology:

    Client-Server Topology: 0.997512 seconds
    Ring Topology: 0.798317 seconds
    Complex-Network Topology: 2.37494 seconds

These running times makes sense because in the Client-Server topology, there are generaly a few hops from origin to destination with a fixed latency between each router
The Ring topology has hops that have a lower latency than the rest of the other topologies hence accounting for the lower running time.
The complex-Network topology has more hops with a more costly latency in the forwarding table which accounts for its high running time.
The size of the row in the forwarding table also increases delay time in figuring out the next hop from a current router.
